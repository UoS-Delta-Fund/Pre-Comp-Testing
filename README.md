Rules and Testing

The aim of the game is to profitably make markets. This means providing liquidity at the best prices at volumes large enough to facilitate the trading activity of other market participants. Your success will lie in identifying profitable opportunities to trade at fair prices, place your orders as quickly as possible, and keep your risk exposures below defined bounds.
